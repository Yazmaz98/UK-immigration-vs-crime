# UK-immigration-vs-crime
This is a statistics project that aims at studying weather a high number of immigrants implies a rise in the number of crimes as well.

To tackle this research I have used 2 datasets from the open data UK government website:
  1. "crime.csv" which is a record of all types of crimes commited in each borough of the UK and the number of times it has occured each month of each year.
  2. "borough_only.csv" which has the yearly number of immigrants in each borough of the UK (this dataset I have actually altered using R to get this desired structure).
  
This project includes:
 - Data prep and cleaning
 - Exploratory data analysis
 - Point estimations and confidence intervals
 - Chi squared tests of independence
 - Statistical visualization of the distribution
 - Goodness of fit tests
 - Linear regression and findings analysis
    Linear model
    Residuals analysis
    Cook's distance
